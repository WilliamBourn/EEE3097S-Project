Quick Setup

This is a guide for setting up the hardware and software with as little work as possible.

#--------------------------
EOZ IP40 Keypad
#--------------------------

Viewing the keypad from the back, the pins D-K, from left to right. Pins D, E, F are connected directly to pins 15, 13, 11 of the Raspberry Pi. Pins D, E, F are also connected
via diode to pin 19 of the Raspberry Pi (The cathode of each diode is at pin 19, while the anode is at pins D, E, F). Pins G, H, J, K are directly connected to pins 24, 22,
18, 16 of the Raspberry Pi.

#--------------------------
RS Pro 150N Lock
#--------------------------

The lock has a red and black terminal, henceforth referred to as positive and negative respectfully. Positive should be connected to an independant power supply no greater
than 24V and the negative terminal should be connected to the collector of a high-power NPN transistor. The emitter of the transistor should be connected to the Ground pin (39)
of the Raspberry Pi, along with the negative terminal of the external power supply. The base pin of the transistor should be connected to pin 37 of the raspberry Pi.

#--------------------------
Mobile Application
#--------------------------

Download the app-debug.apk file from the repo and move it onto your android device in any folder you wish. Find the file on your device and tap it to open it, you will be prompted with "Install blocked, Your device does not allow you to install these types of files", you will have to click settings and grant access to the installation of apps from unknown sources on your device. Then tap the file again and you will be prompted to install the apk, tap "install" and then when you are prompted "This software may be harmful to your device" tap "install anyway". Once installed open the app.
Pressing the open and close buttons on the app should provide feedback from the 'Gate-Closed Light' at the top of the app, this is how you know that the app is installed and working correctly.

#--------------------------
Server
#--------------------------

Once everything has been set up, run server.py. By using the buttons of the app, the server on the Raspberry Pi will receive the HTTP requests and operate based upon them. End the server by typing in cntrl + C for a keyboard interupt.
